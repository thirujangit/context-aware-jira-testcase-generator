# 🧠 Context-Aware Jira Test Case Generator

This FastAPI application generates detailed functional, negative, and edge test cases for Jira user stories using TogetherAI and document-based context (PDF/DOCX). It uses semantic search (FAISS) to retrieve the most relevant document chunks and includes them in the prompt to enhance test case accuracy.
